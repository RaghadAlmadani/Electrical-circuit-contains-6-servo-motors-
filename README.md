Create an electrical circuit contains 6 servo motors using simulation websites here I will use [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard).

### Defintions:

- Electrical circuit -> is a system of interconnected components that allows electric current to flow, powering electronic devices by controlling the movement of electricity.

+ Arduino UNO -> is a popular microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P chip. It's widely used in electronics projects and prototyping due to its ease of use and versatility. The Uno board includes digital and analog input/output pins that can be programmed to interact with various sensors, actuators, and other electronic components. It's known for being beginner-friendly while offering enough capabilities for more advanced projects, making it a staple in the maker and DIY electronics communities.

- Breadboard -> is a solderless prototyping board used to build and test electronic circuits. It features a grid of holes into which components can be inserted and connected without soldering. This allows for easy experimentation and modification of circuit designs, making it a valuable tool for both beginners and experienced electronics enthusiasts.

- Sevro motor -> is a device that translates an electrical signal into precise mechanical motion. It typically consists of a motor, a position sensor, and a control circuit. Servo motors are widely used in applications requiring accurate control of position, speed, and acceleration, such as robotics, industrial automation, and remote-controlled systems.
