Create an electrical circuit contains 6 servo motors using simulation websites here I will use [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard).

### Defintions:

 <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.32uGkXWuex0kAledYhpcBQAAAA?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain" width="200" />
- Electrical circuit -> is a system of interconnected components that allows electric current to flow, powering electronic devices by controlling the movement of electricity.

- Arduino UNO -> is a popular microcontroller board based on the ATmega328P chip. It's widely used in electronics projects and prototyping due to its ease of use and versatility. The Uno board includes digital and analog input/output pins that can be programmed to interact with various sensors, actuators, and other electronic components. It's known for being beginner-friendly while offering enough capabilities for more advanced projects, making it a staple in the maker and DIY electronics communities.

- Breadboard -> is a solderless prototyping board used to build and test electronic circuits. It features a grid of holes into which components can be inserted and connected without soldering. This allows for easy experimentation and modification of circuit designs, making it a valuable tool for both beginners and experienced electronics enthusiasts.

- Sevro motor -> is a device that translates an electrical signal into precise mechanical motion. It typically consists of a motor, a position sensor, and a control circuit. Servo motors are widely used in applications requiring accurate control of position, speed, and acceleration, such as robotics, industrial automation, and remote-controlled systems.

- Digital signal ->  is a type of signal used in electronics and telecommunications that represents data as discrete values, typically binary numbers (0 and 1). These signals are characterized by their distinct, finite levels and are processed and transmitted using digital techniques.
  
- Analog signal -> An analog signal is a continuous electrical signal that varies smoothly and continuously over time. It can represent any value within a range of values and is used in various electronic systems to convey information through continuously varying quantities such as voltage, current, or frequency. Analog signals are fundamental in applications such as audio transmission, analog sensors, and traditional television signals.
